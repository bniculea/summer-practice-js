# How to run

- Install docker (Docker desktop)
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the root folder and open a terminal there
- Run `docker compose up`
- In another terminal but in the same location, run `npm start`

## Note:
- See in the docker-compose.yml ports for Mongo-Express
    - By default, if there are no problems, you should open the mongo-express at: localhost:27017
